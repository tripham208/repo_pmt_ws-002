## Athena Federation


### Query Data Anywhere

- Run federated queries against relational databases, data warehouses, object stores, and non-relational data stores. Federated SQL queries allow you to query the data in-place from wherever it resides. You can use familiar SQL to JOIN data across multiple data sources for quick analysis, and store results in Amazon S3 for subsequent use. Athena federated query also introduces a new Query Federation SDK that allows you to write your own data source connectors to query custom data stores.
