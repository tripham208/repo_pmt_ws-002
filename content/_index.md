# Amazon Athena Workshop
Analyze petabyte-scale data where it lives with ease and flexibility
### Overview

In this workshop, we will explore the features of Amazon Athena and run hands-on labs that demonstrate Amazon Athena features and best practices.
### How it works
[Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/?nc1=h_ls) is a serverless, interactive analytics service built on open-source frameworks, supporting open-table and file formats. Athena provides a simplified, flexible way to analyze petabytes of data where it lives. Analyze data or build applications from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) data lake and 30 data sources, including on-premises data sources or other cloud systems using SQL or Python. Athena is built on open-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no provisioning or configuration effort required.
