## Introduction
In this workshop, we will use:
- **IAM:** IAM provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. With IAM, you can control access to services and resources under specific conditions. Use IAM policies to manage permissions for your workforce and systems. IAM is offered at no additional charge.


- **S3:** Amazon S3 is cloud object storage with industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. S3 is ideal for data lakes, mobile applications, backup and restore, archival, IoT devices, ML, AI, and analytics.


- **Athena:** Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run. Athena is easy to use. Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL. Most results are delivered within seconds. With Athena, thereâ€™s no need for complex ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis. This makes it easy for anyone with SQL skills to quickly analyze large-scale datasets. Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema versioning.


- **CloudFormation:** AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that. The following scenarios demonstrate how CloudFormation can help.


- **RDS:** Amazon RDS is an easy to manage relational database service optimized for total cost of ownership. It is simple to set up, operate, and scale with demand. Amazon RDS automates the undifferentiated database management tasks, such as provisioning, configuring, backups, and patching. Amazon RDS enables customers to create a new database in minutes, and offers flexibility to customize databases to meet their needs across 8 engines and 2 deployment options. Customers can optimize performance with features, like Multi-AZ with two readable standbys, Optimized Writes and Reads, and AWS Graviton3-based instances, and choose from multiple pricing options to effectively manage costs.
